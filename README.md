# Flast_backend_blog

This homework is trying to build a Flask backend application
for my personal blog. It includes 3 routes where the response
renders HTML using jinja2 templates. It also has an attempt for 
having one dynamic route where the contents of the page change
based on the parameter passed in the URL in the about page that 
lists the works. 
It contains: 
* Program "app.py" with the Flask framework
* Folder named "templates" that includes html files for the blog - "homework.html", "About.html", "Works.html", and "base.html"
* Folder named "static" that includes folder named "css" with "my.css" program in it and the pictures
* Other important folders and files for this homework
